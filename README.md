# FLAG: Flexible and Accurate Methods for Estimation and Inference of Gaussian Graphical Models with Applications in R

The R package `FLAG` implements the methods based on the paper [**Flexible and Accurate Methods for Estimation and Inference of Gaussian Graphical Models with Applications**](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2306.17584).
The \ul{fl}exible and \ul{a}ccurate \ul{G}aussian graphical model (FLAG) aims to estimate precision matrix entries accurately and efficiently, and further quantify the uncertainty of each entry, which allows for better leveraging of the common structure across different groups through meta-analysis.

## Installation

For a quick start, you can install the development version of `FLAG`
from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("YangLabHKUST/FLAG")
```
